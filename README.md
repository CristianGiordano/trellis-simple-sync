# trellis-simple-sync
Ansible playbooks for Trellis database and uploads sync.\
Just copy and run without any extra configuration.

## Installation
1. Copy `database.yml` and `uploads.yml` files into Trellis root folder
2. Copy `bin/sync.sh` files into Trellis bin folder
3. (Optional) Add `db-backup-*.sql.gz` to your Bedrock `.gitignore` file

## Usage
Run `./bin/sync.sh <environment> <site name> <type> <mode>`

* Available `<type>` options: `uploads`, `database`, `all`
* Available `<mode>` options: `push`, `pull`
* The `push` is for upload data from development and update selected environment, and the `pull` for download data from selected environment and update development.
* `uploads` sync is not destructive, it only adds or update new files, don't delete missing files.
* On every database sync a datetimed backup `db-backup-YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS.sql.gz` is saved before import data.

## Aliases
You can use alias for a shorter or more intuitive commands

* staging - stag - s
* production - prod - p
* database - db
* uploads - media
* push - up
* pull - down

Examples:\
`./bin/sync.sh stag example.com db up`\
`./bin/sync.sh prod example.com media down`\
`./bin/sync.sh prod example.com all up`

## Skipping GUIDs

Skipping the GUID column is the default behaviour as it can have unwanted effects on production environments. If you are sure you want to replace GUID URLs, for example if you are deploying a site to production for the first time, you can prevent skipping GUIDs with `--extra-vars "skip_guids=false"`.

Example:\
`./bin/sync.sh prod example.com db up --extra-vars "skip_guids=false"`

## Notes
* Tested up to Ansible 2.6.1
* Replace Elementor urls on database sync (if installed).
* For database sync the development vagrant VM must be powered on every time you run a command
* On every database sync a `db-backup-YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS.sql.gz` file is automatically created inside destination environment Bedrock folder. In development, if you don't want it to be saved in the repository:
    * You can add `db-backup-*.sql.gz` to your Bedrock `.gitignore` file
    * Or you can comment `PULL > Backup development database` task on `database.yml`

## Contribute
